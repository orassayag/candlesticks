Note: the solution is separated to client and server projects, to keep things clear.

1. Open the server project on the IDE (I used VS CODE).
2. On the terminal: npm i (and wait to download all node_modules folder).
3. Once finished, on the terminal: node index.js
4. Open the client project on another IDE.
5. On the terminal: npm i (again, wait to download all node_modules folder).
6. Once finished, on the terminal: npm start
7. Wait 10 seconds once you see the loading animation to collect enough data for the first candlestick.
8. Happy testing :)

Application main features:
1. Candlesticks will create automatically when they are .
2. After 30 seconds, the user can change the interval (10,30) seconds.
3. After 30 chunks of data received by the server, a button of latests candlesticks will be displayed, getting the last candlesticks from the server.

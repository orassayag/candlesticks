# Candlesticks

Built in December 2018.
React + Node.js (Websocket + Express) application to create candlesticks (Price chart) by intervals.

## Getting Started

Clone the project to your computer.
Steps to view the solution:
1. Open the server project on the IDE (I used VS CODE).
2. On the terminal: npm i (and wait to download all node_moudles folder).
3. Once finished, on the terminal: node index.js
4. Open the client project on another IDE.
5. On the terminal: npm i (again, wait to download all node_moudles folder).
6. Once finished, on the terminal: npm start
7. Wait 10 seconds once you see the loading animation to collect enough data for the first candlestick.
8. Happy testing :)
